## Vocabulary you might come across

1. Analog
   Analog technology is any piece of technology that does its job without processing numbers electronically like a computer does. You might think of analog as “old-school” technology, like film cameras or tape recorders.

2. Bandwidth
   This term refers to the amount of information that can be transmitted or processed, either wirelessly or across a hardwired connection. Internet services will advertise fast speeds measured in bandwidth, so it is a well-known component of the IT world.

3. Big data
   Big data is a quick way to refer to the massive amounts of data that companies collect on a day-to-day basis. Corporations face a number of challenges of managing big data, especially when it comes to analysis and security.

4. Bit
   Bit is an abbreviation for “binary digit,” the smallest piece of information used by a computer. Each bit is either a 1 or a 0, which are the binary digits that make up computer language. Bits are literally the foundation upon which computer science is built. Since they’re so miniscule, computer whizzes also need to know some basic tech math to think of bits on a larger scale:

```
Byte= 8 bits
Kilobyte = 1024 bytes
Megabyte= 1024 kilobytes
Gigabyte= 1024 megabytes
```

5. Bug
   A bug is a programming error that causes unexpected glitches or problems for a program’s end user.

6. Cloud storage
   Cloud storage is an alternative to storing data on a computer’s physical storage. Information that’s stored “on the cloud” is kept on remote servers that can be accessed anywhere via the Internet.

7. Code
   Code refers to different programming languages used to create, edit or manage computer programs or applications. Most computer science students will specialize in a small handful of coding languages depending on the career they’d like to pursue.

8. Control panel
   Just like it sounds,the control panel is a tool that allows you to change a program’s settings or alter the way it looks or behaves.

9. CPU
   CPU stands for the Central Processing Unit, which is the processing chip and "brains" of a computer.

10. Data security
    This is the process of protecting data from unauthorized users or hackers.

11. Debug
    Debugging refers to the process of finding and removing errors from a program's source code. The goal is for programmers to discover and fix bugs before their end user experiences problems.

12. Digital
    Digital technology is the opposite of analog. It’s anything that uses a computer’s binary language to do its job. To digitize something is to convert analog data into digital data that can be used by a computer.

13. Disk storage
    Disk storage refers to a computer’s hard drive or long-term memory. This is where a computer stores information that isn’t being used at the time. If disk storage becomes too full, a computer may become sluggish as it takes the time to wade through all that data.

14. Ethernet
    Ethernet is similar to the Internet. It’s a system connecting a number of computers or devices to the same network, allowing for fast, monitored transmission of data. Ethernets have restricted network access that’s managed by a handful of system administrators, making it a secure network solution for many companies.

15. Hacker
    This term can refer to an expert programmer. But it’s most common usage is referring to someone who can gain unauthorized access, or “hack,” other computers or networks. IT specialists can earn qualifications to become a certified ethical hacker.

16. HTML
    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is a coding language used to write Internet-based documents, like websites. It’s one of the basic coding languages you’ll most likely learn early in your computer science career.

17. Hub
    This device is a central connection for all computers in a network, which is usually Ethernet-based. Information sent to the hub can flow to any other computer on the network.

18. Index
    An index is a list of data, such as a group of files or database entries. It is typically saved in a plain text format so a computer can quickly scan it to retrieve the information it needs.

19. IP address
    Also known as an "IP number" or simply an "IP," this is a numerical code that identifies a specific computer on the Internet. Think of it as a computer’s unique Social Security Number.

20. LAN
    LAN stands for "Local Area Network." This is a small computer network, often located within just a single room. (Think your high school or college computer lab.)

21. Plain text
    Unformatted text that doesn’t support italics, underlining, bold characters, fonts or font sizes.

22. Processor
    Also referred to as the microprocessor, this little chip is the heart of a computer. The processor does all of the computations for the computer—meaning it’s in charge of every piece of input and output that comes a computer’s way! Speed is important when it comes to processors and many can handle trillions of calculations per second.

23. RAM
    This is an acronym for Random-Access Memory, the place where a computer stores data while it is being used or changed. Think of it as a computer’s short-term memory. It doesn’t have unlimited storage, but it makes for quick access to information you’re currently using.

24. ROM
    ROM stands for Read Only Memory. This is memory that can only be read from and not written to. Computers use ROM to store important tasks like start-up processes and software instructions.
